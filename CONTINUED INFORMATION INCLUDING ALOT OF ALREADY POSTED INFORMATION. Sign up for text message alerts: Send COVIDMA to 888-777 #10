Caution

There have been reports of people receiving fraudulent texts, calls and emails directing them to apply for SNAP (food stamps) or to boost their SNAP benefits. DTA has contracted community partners who may be reaching out to you. A list of partners can be found here. If the message is from someone not on the list nor DTA, it is likely a scam to obtain your personal information. In Massachusetts, the only way to apply for SNAP benefits online is through DTAConnect.com. DTA and our partners will never ask for your credit card information.

Never provide personal information or your credit card number over the phone to unidentified callers. If you think you may have been contacted by one of these scams call the Attorney Generalâ€™s office at (617) 727-8400 to speak with a Consumer Specialist.
